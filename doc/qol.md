## cache

Some plugins save their state in the cache. If you want to reset the state of a
plugin, you can delete the cache.

```sh
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
```

Others will save files to ~/.local/share/nvim. You can delete these files, too.

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
```

| `<plugin>`       | note                        | `<path>`                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `blink`          | Blink.cmp completion cache  | `~/.local/share/nvim/blink`   |
| `mason`          | Mason packages and binaries | `~/.local/share/nvim/mason`   |
| `Snacks.scratch` | Snacks scratch buffers      | `~/.local/share/nvim/scratch` |
| `Snacks.picker`  | Snacks picker histories     | `~/.local/share/nvim/snacks`  |
